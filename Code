// TikTacToe Game Assignment
Objecitve: Write a C++ program that allows two players to play the Tic-Tac-Toe game using a class-based design.
Program Requirements
1. Class Name
TicTacToe --- The class must represent the entire game.

2. Private Members
A 3×3 2D array board[3][3] to store the moves ('X', 'O', or ' ').
Additional variables as needed (e.g., current player, move count, game status).
3. Public Member Functions
void displayBoard() → Print the current game board.\
bool isValidMove(int row, int col) → Check if a move is valid.\
void makeMove(int row, int col) → Place the move on the board.\
bool checkWinner() → Determine if there's a winner.\
bool isDraw() → Check for draw condition.\
void playGame() → Run the full game loop.
4. Gameplay Rules
Player 1 uses 'X', Player 2 uses 'O'.
Players take turns entering row and column numbers (1--3).
After each move, the board updates and the winner/draw is checked.
